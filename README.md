#NFTokenomics lightpaper
In datalatte.ai, we share the pie.
Why NFT.datalatte.ai?
We have thought long about this in our team before introducing our NFTs. We wanted something more than just a collectible. Something that can empower our community. Something that can excel the way we go forward as not only a project, but also a movement.

That's why we decided to share our pie with all our NFT holders. The pie is actually the fees collected by datalatte marketplace. Meaning, each consumption of data in our marketplace has a fee. All the fees are accumulated into a pie-pool. Only our NFT holders can receive a share of the pie-pool by staking their NFT to the pie-pool.

So before coming to the numbers “NFTokenomics”, let us tell you a story.
An NFT Story
10101 DAO members gathered together to decide on an important parameter in datalatte.ai marketplace protocol. Their names are:

Dia	(artificial intelligent data)			Quantity: 1
Isa 	(artificial super intelligent)			Quantity: 100
Iga	(artificial general intelligent)			Quantity: 1000
Ina	(artifical narrow intelligent)			Quantity: 9000
						Sum:       10101

Hodler of Dia is the DAO operational chief. The hodler team of Dia is chosen by the DAO every 4 years to be the operational chief. 
Meaning the core team of datalatte.ai will be only holding on to Dia for 4 more years and afterward, the Dia NFT is up for vote.

All DAO members (hodlers of Dia, Isa, Iga and Ina) will receive part of the pie.
How much of the Pie?
Isa, Iga, Ina = Dia’s pie /2π
Why π?
Because in every pie, there are two π. Also who wouldn't want to have a pie next to their datalatte!?

Who decides on the NFT intelligence when minting?
Randomness. It's completely random, if your NFT would be a Isa, iga or Ina. Obviously Isa is more rare, so less chance for everyone to receive it. We thought it might be fun to spice it up with a bit of gambling. The result is that higher intelligence NFTs have a much bigger share of the pie (approx x10 times). It rhymes with the reality of world wealth distribution as well, so after all, it's just how reality is.
Can we increase the intelligence of the NFTs?

Yes, you can. Each NFT holder can increase the intelligence of their NFT by completing data quests. Data quests can be publishing new data, bringing new publishers to the datalatte.ai marketplace, any customized quests that benefit the datalatte.ai community.

By completing each of these data quests, the NFT hodler increases its share of the pie by a reward.

How big is the reward?
reward= NFT’s pie /2π/10

After all, there is just one pie (zero sum game), so who would contribute to the reward?
Any NFT holder who has a share of the pie which is higher than equality. 

What is equality?
Imagine dividing the pie, fair and square between all NFT holders: Equality=pie/10101

Do all NFT holders higher than equality, pay equal part in the reward?
Nope, it's most fair to pay more when your piece of pie is bigger. We defined a ratio called Communize ratio. The higher is your piece of pie, the higher is your Communize ratio and share more to rewards. 

According to our simulations, for at least few years, Dia stays the major pie holder and with time its dominance shrinks. This way, it gives enough time for datalatte.ai marketplace to benefit from its own revenue to be able to scale. However, with time marketplace revenue can increase exponentially, therefore datalatte’s pie piece gets smaller and is distributed to all other active pie holders who complete data quests. This way a fair game is initiated with our NFT holders to benefit equally in the long term.

A simulation of such NFTs sharing the pie is done with a simplified vector based linear model in MATLAB. The x-axis shows the iterations in the model with a randomly chosen NFT completing a data quest. The number of NFTs in this simulation is 1101 given the limitations of vector sizes and reducing computation time. However, the pie shares given to each category is kept the same as for 10101.

Are all these parameters fixed? 
Nope, this is just to open the discussion and start the work. To set it in stone, more simulations especially with TokenSPICE is needed to make the business model viable for the DAO operator to reach sustainability. It might be that some parameters slightly change, but pie will be shared at the end!
Who decides for any changes?
You. There are 101 NFTs available, ready to claim for free. All you need to have:
Metamask wallet with any $Ocean amount in it
NetflixViewingHistory.csv 

Why $Ocean? 
Because $Ocean is our immediate community and datalatte.ai has been funded for a total of 32,222 $Ocean by OceanDAO.

Why NetflixViewingHistory.csv?
To develop our AI feature store and develop our main NFT drop backend, we need data to start off.

What is the NFT main drop?
After distributing these 101 NFTs, we ask the holders to be fair and select the most lovable character to make our main NFT drop based on the selected character. We have been working on traits and variations which makes NFTs unique to the NFT hodler based on their Netflix data. We like to ask all those NFT holders to join us building it together as a community. We need your data to gain its intelligence, developing for 10101 NFTs.

What happens to the first 101 NFTs after the main drop?
All the first 101 NFTs are part of the total 10101 NFTs. Once our main drop comes, every 101 first NFT holders will have a new NFT and the intelligence will be migrated automatically in our AI explorer. One can keep the first 101 NFT as well, however it will not be entitled to any share of the pie! It's good to have a collectible piece of history to keep! :D 

How can i get the first 101 NFTs!
You need to join our discord channel. Here, our bots will make sure to put you on the whitelist and record your ETH public address. Remember, ETH public address must have any amount of $Ocean token.

Wen DAO?
As soon as you get your NFT, you immediately become part of datalatte.ai DAO. We believe in a future where platforms are owned and governed by the community. Therefore, we are inviting everyone to come and share the pie with us. We will work on our future pie recipes together as a community and introduce other delicious recipes together.
